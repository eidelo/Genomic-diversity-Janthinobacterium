#Comparative genomics were done using pyPGCF pipeline. This package were installed by the following command:
mamba install -c mnikolaidis -c conda-forge -c bioconda pypgcf==0.1.3


#species demarcation module was used with the genomic fasta sequences as input
pyPGCF species_demarcation -in genomic/ -o comparative_analyses/ --fastani_cores 4

#Ortholouges module was used with protein sequences as input, and J. lividum (GCF_013372045.1) as reference, output of this was a .csv file called OGmatrix.csv
pyPGCF orthologues -in protein/ -o comparative_analyses/ -ref GCF_013372045

#Used the orthologues to find the core genes
pyPGCF core -in Orthologues/GCF_013372045/OGmatrix.csv -o .

#To construct the phylogenomic tree the phylogenomic function was used
