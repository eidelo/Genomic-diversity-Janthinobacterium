These scripts were used to construct a phylogenetic tree based on _Janthinobacterium_ genomes, and to construct a pangenome.
The scripts within 01_construct_pangenome.txt is used to construct pangenomes. This script requires .fa files of the genomes to be analysed.

The script 01_download_organize_genomes.txt is used to download and organize protein and DNA-files of the genomes listed in janthinobacterium_genome_list.txt. These codes uses file_organizer.py to organize the protein and genome files.
The scripts in 02_comparative_genomics.txt is used to do comparative genomic analyses, and construct a phylogenetic tree based on core genes of the _Janthinobacterium_ genomes.
